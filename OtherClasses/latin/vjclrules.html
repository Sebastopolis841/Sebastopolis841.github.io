		<h1>How to play <em>Gladius!</em></h1>
		<hr>
		<br>

		<p><em>Gladius!</em> is the game I made for my <em>VJCL(Virginia Junior Classical League)</em> project. This website will be used to show all of the rules and peices of the game. After the making of this game I was informed of another game also called Gladius. This should not be an issue because I do not plan to put this game on the public market.</p>

		<h2>Setup</h2>
		<hr>
		<br>

		<p>Every good game begins with the setup. For this game, the setup is as follows:</p>

		<div class="rules">	
			<ol>
				<li>Set each player's health to 10 a peice of paper. This paper will be used to keep score</li>
				<br>

				<li>Shuffle each player's deck of cards</li>
				<br>

				<li>Give each player the starting materials:
					<ul>
						<br>

						<li><strong>1</strong> blood token. This is the currency of the game and is used to summon gladiators and to cast spells so you can win the game.</li>
						<br>

						<li><strong>1</strong> weak gladiator. This is the weakest gladiator in the game. Each player starts with one.</li>
						<br>

						<li><strong>7</strong> cards drawn from their deck. These can be played in accordance with the rules based on their blood costs.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>Parts of a turn</h2>
		<hr>
		<br>

		<p>There are 5 phases of a turn. These are <strong>upkeep</strong>, <strong>main</strong>, <strong>gladiator     combat</strong>, <strong>player combat</strong>, and <strong>end</strong>.</p>

		<div class="rules">
			<ol>
					<li><strong>Upkeep:</strong> In the upkeep phase, the players will ready their gladiators, and their lands will be triggered as well as claiming their blood token(s). On top of this, the active player will also draw a card. They may also discard any amount of cards to draw a the same amounr of cards</li>
					<br>

					<li><strong>Main:</strong> In the main phase, the player will play their lands and gladiators to prepare for the gladiator fight ahead.</li>
					<br>

		<h2>Card types</h2>
		<hr>
		<br>

		<p>There are 4 card types. These are <strong>gladiators</strong>, <strong>lands</strong>, <strong>spells</strong>, and <strong>tokens</strong></p>
		<br>

		<div class="subheader">
			<div class="fix">
				
				<br>
				<h3>Gladiators</h3>
	
				<p><strong>Gladiators</strong> are the creatures that attack and defend against the opposing player. These have health, attack, blood cost, and ability.</p>
			
				<div class="rules">
					<dl>
						<dt><strong>Health:</strong></dt>
						<dd>This is how much health the creature has. This is the second number on the bottom right of the card, and it is lowered when it blocks or attacks.</dd>
						<br>
						
						<dt><strong>Attack:</strong></dt>
						<dd>This is how much damage this creature deals to an opposing player or gladiator. When attacking, a gladiator will deal damage equal to the attack stat.</dd>
		
						<br>
		
						<dt><strong>Blood cost:</strong></dt>
						<dd>This is how much it costs to play the card in blood tokens. Blood tokens are aqquired over time and by defeating the opposing player's gladiators.</dd>
		
						<br>
		
						<dt><strong>Ability:</strong></dt>
						<dd>Almost all creatures have a special ability written at the bottom of the card. This ability can make the card weaker or stronger depending on the card. An ability is not a spell, and it's effects are triggered differently based on the ability.</dd>

						<br>

						<dt><strong>Restrictions:</strong></dt>
						<dd>There are, obviously, restrictions on the gladiators to make sure they aren't too powerful. When a gladiator hits a player, the gladiator dies, though neither player receives blood points for the attack. On top of that, whenever a gladiator attacks, it is disables and cannot attack, block, or even use it's ability until the next turn.</dd>
					</dl>
				</div>

				<br>
				<h3>Lands</h3>

				<p><strong>Lands</strong> are powerful cards that can have varying effects from allowing different cards to be played to giving extra tokens or cards each turn.<p>
				
				<div class="rules">
					<dl>
						<dt><strong>Blood Cost:</strong></dt>
						<dd>Some lands are free to play and will have a blood cost of 0. Otherwise, when playing the land, you lose that many blood points.</dd>

						<br>

						<dt><strong>Ability:</strong></dt>
						<dd>All lands have an ability on the bottom of the card. This is used to show what the card does. If the ability is giving you something, you gain that during the upkeep step.</dd>

						<br>

						<dt><strong>Restrictions:</strong></dt>
						<dd>Land cards can be powerful, and therefore there are restrictions on them. On your turn, you are only allowed to play 1 land and that's it.</dd>
					</dl>
				</div>

				<br>
				<h3>Spells</h3>

				<p><strong>Spells</strong> are some of the most powerful cards in the game. One of these cards can even result in a tie, something that no other card can do.</p>

				<div class="rules">
					<dl>
						<dt><strong>Blood Cost:</strong></dt>
						<dd>Due to them being so powerful, spells are some of the most expensive cards. Their cost is in the top right and ranges from 3 - 5 blood tokens</dd>

						<br>

						<dt><strong>Ability:</strong></dt>
						<dd>Spells have the most powerful abilities on any card. When you play the card, the ability, shown at the bottom of the card, happens immediately.</dd>

						<br>

						<dt><strong>Restrictions:</strong></dt>
						<dd>Spells can be the most powerful cards in the game, and naturally there are restrictions on them. Unless the card says otherwise, when you play a spell, it is instantly discarded. On top of this, kills made using spells do not award blood tokens.</dd>
					</dl>
				</div>

				<br>
				<h3>Tokens</h3>

				<p><strong>Tokens</strong> are the cards/chips that cannot be played. The following are tokens:</p>

				<div class="rules">
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Blood tokens</strong> are a type of token. These are the currency of the game.</li>

						<br>

						<li><strong>Weak gladiators</strong> are also a type of token. These are abilitiless gladiators with 1 attack and 1 health.</li>
					</ul>
