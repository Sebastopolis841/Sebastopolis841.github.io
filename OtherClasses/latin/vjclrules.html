		<h1>How to play <em>Gladius!</em></h1>
		<hr>
		<br>

		<p><em>Gladius!</em> is the game I made for my <em>VJCL</em>(Virginia Junior Classical Convention) project. This website will be used to show all of the rules and peices of the game.</p>

		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>Setup</h2>
		<hr>
		<br>

		<p>Every good game begins with the setup. For this game, the setup is as follows:</p>

		<div class="rules">	
			<ol>
				<li>Set each player's health to 10 a peice of paper. This paper will be used to keep score</li>
	
				<li>Shuffle each player's dack of cards</li>

				<li>Give each player the starting materials:
					<ul>
						<li>1 blood token. This is the currency of the game and is used to summon gladiators and to cast spells so you can win the game.</li>

						<li>1 weak gladiator. This is the weakest gladiator in the game. Each player starts with one.</li>

						<li>7 cards drawn from their deck. These can be played in accordance with the rules based on their blood costs.</li>
