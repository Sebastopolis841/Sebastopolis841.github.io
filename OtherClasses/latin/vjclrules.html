		<h1>How to play <em>Gladius!</em></h1>
		<hr>
		<br>

		<p><em>Gladius!</em> is the game I made for my <em>VJCL</em>(Virginia Junior Classical Convention) project. This website will be used to show all of the rules and peices of the game.</p>

		<h2>Setup</h2>
		<hr>
		<br>

		<p>Every good game begins with the setup. For this game, the setup is as follows:</p>

		<div class="rules">	
			<ol>
				<li>Set each player's health to 10 a peice of paper. This paper will be used to keep score</li>
	
				<li>Shuffle each player's deck of cards</li>

				<li>Give each player the starting materials:
					<ul>
						<li>1 blood token. This is the currency of the game and is used to summon gladiators and to cast spells so you can win the game.</li>

						<li>1 weak gladiator. This is the weakest gladiator in the game. Each player starts with one.</li>

						<li>7 cards drawn from their deck. These can be played in accordance with the rules based on their blood costs.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>Parts of a turn</h2>
		<hr>
		<br>

		<p>There are 5 phases of a turn. These are <strong>upkeep</strong>, <strong>main</strong>, <strong>gladiator     combat</strong>, <strong>player combat</strong>, and <strong>end</strong>.</p>

		<div class="rules">
			<ul>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Upkeep:</strong> In the upkeep phase, the players will ready their gladiators, and their lands will be triggered as well as claiming their blood token(s)</li>

					<li><strong>Main:</strong> In the main phase, the player will play their lands and gladiators to prepare for the gladiator fight ahead.</li>

					<li><strong>Gladiator combat:</strong> In the gladiator combat phase, the player can directly attack the enemies gladiators to weaken them before the player combat phase</li>
						
					<li><strong>Player combat:</strong> In the player combat phase, the active player can atteck their opponent. Unlike the gladiator combat phase, the opponent can block these attacks using their gladiators. Whenever a gladiator lands a hit on the opposing player, that gladiator dies</li>

					<li><strong>End:</strong> During the end phase, very little happens. the active player declares the end of their turn and their opponent's turn begins.</li>
				</ol>
			</ul>
		</div>
