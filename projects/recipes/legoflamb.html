		<p>I chose this recipe because it is one of my favorite christmas tradition that my family celebrates.
		Every year on Serbian(Orthodox) Christmas, My family makes roast leg of lamb and calls my grandparents on my mother's side and we all celebrate Serbian christmas together.
		We have been doing thes for as long as I can remember, and it is one of my favorite christmas traditions.</p>
		
		<p>A quote from my grandmother is <q>I love this recipe for Leg of Lamb. The garlic gives it so much extra flavor and the meat is tender and delicious!</q></p>

				<th>Tips and Substitutions</th>
				<td>
					<ul>
						<li>Lemons are optional, but do improve the flavor</li>
						<li>It is best to get a bone in leg of lamb, but it is fine to use boneless leg of lamb if neccesary, as shown in the image. If you do this, instead of instructions 7 and 8, do this instead:
							<ol>
								<li>Tie lamb together using twine</li>
								<li>Cook lamb at 275˚ for 3 hours</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>For fuller meal, add these steps to the instructions:
							<ol>
								<li>Peel and rinse 6 russet potatoes</li>
								<li>Cut the potatoes into wedges and place around lamb</li>
						</li>
					</ul>
