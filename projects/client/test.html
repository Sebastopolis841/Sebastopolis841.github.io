                    We got hitched at the courthouse in 2021 and knew we wanted to have a real wedding with our friends and family someday. 
                    We don't go to a church and did not know who to trust. 
                    Reverend Eli met with us free of charge, asked to hear our story, and told us why he wanted to help us. 
                    We met six more times until we had a plan for our own special day, with our own vows and our own values. 
                    We've been husband and wife since 2021, but after our ceremony we now feel truly married. 
                    Eli is the best!

                    My partner and I wanted a personalized ceremony that let us celebrate who we are as individuals and as a couple. 
                    We didn't hire a wedding planner and didn't know where to start. 
                    Reverend Eli gave us a business card at a crafts store while shopping for another couples' wedding and we immediately knew that he would go the extra mile to make sure that our day was unique and unforgettable. 
                    He introduced us to caterers, musicians and florists and got us a great rate. 
                    Thanks Reverend Eli!
